## File description
 - hmm.py - Contains HMM implementation (adapter for NLTK). If called directly, scans over different configurations:
 ngram: [1..9], smoothing:{MLE, Laplace, Add-\delta [0.1,0.2,...0.9], GoodTuring}. Seed is fixed to 0 to ensure 
 reproducability.
 - memm.py - Contains MEMM implementation (using sklearn for optimization). If called directly,
 scans over combinations of possible features: ['IS_FIRST', 'IS_LAST', 'IDX', 'VAL', 'PRV_VAL', 'NXT_VAL', 'FRST_VAL', 'LST_VAL', 'SCND_VAL', 'SCND_LST_VAL', 'LEN'].
 Seed is fixed to 0 to ensure reproducability.
